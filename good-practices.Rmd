# R for research

## Why think about R for research?

- Useability: well structured code is easier to read, write, run and maintain
   - … For yourself (now & in the future) and others
- Reproducibility and collaboration: this is where “open science” happens
- Good infrastructure helps structure your own thinking

# An introduction to good practices
- This session aims to provide a (not comprehensive) collection of tips and pointers - follow up those you find useful
- Emphasis on project infrastructure and workflows: not individual code scripts
- “Good” practices are what works for you and your collaborators
