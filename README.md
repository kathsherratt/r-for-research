#### Questions & resources

- Using R with large or confidential data sets 
  - This guide covers many useful practices, including the highly recommended `data.table` package:
    - <https://marketsplash.com/tutorials/r/how-to-handle-large-datasets-in-r>
  - `Arrow` is a great option for storing very large (roughly >8GB) datasets efficiently, and can be read into R (almost) as easily as a .csv file:
    - <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/arrow.html>
  - When using Github with large or confidential data sets, one strategy might be to use the `.gitignore` file to prevent Github from tracking or uploading a given data file:
    - <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files>
- Writing reports with Rmarkdown
  - An example of a paper using Rmarkdown:
    - <https://github.com/epiforecasts/euro-hub-ensemble/tree/main/analysis>
  - Using `trackdown` for tracking changes with google docs:
    - <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trackdown/vignettes/trackdown-workflow.html>
